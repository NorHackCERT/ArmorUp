# ArmorUp
Comprehensive Windows Security and Privacy Toolkit – Ideal for Schools, Students, and General Users.
---

## Overview
ArmorUp is a lightweight and effective toolkit designed to rapidly enhance the security and privacy of Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. It focuses on disabling legacy vulnerabilities, improving privacy settings, enforcing secure system behavior, and ensuring critical updates are installed — all in a single streamlined process.

---

## Why ArmorUp?

Modern education and everyday environments face constant cybersecurity threats. ArmorUp addresses this by:

- **Reducing the system's attack surface**: ArmorUp disables vulnerable legacy protocols like NetBIOS, SMBv1, LLMNR, AutoPlay, and Remote Assistance, significantly lowering the risk of remote attacks and malware infiltration.
- **Enhancing user privacy and protecting personal information**: By disabling Telemetry, Advertising ID, Location Services, and enabling DNS over HTTPS (DoH), ArmorUp ensures that user activities and location data are kept private.
- **Protecting against ransomware and physical access attacks**: Controlled Folder Access is activated to protect important folders from ransomware attacks, while screen lock policies with password protection prevent unauthorized physical access.
- **Ensuring devices stay updated and resilient**: Automatic triggering of Windows Update ensures critical patches are installed, maintaining system integrity against known vulnerabilities.

ArmorUp is designed to be simple, fast, and effective — ideal for students, teachers, IT administrators, and everyday users.
